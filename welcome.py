    #### Motivation
    
    Alzheimer's disease is an irreversible, progression neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss, mental dysfunction, 
    and changes in personality. Eventually, neuronal damage of Alzheimer's becomes so extensive, parts of the brain that enable basic bodily functions, 
    such as walking or swallowing, may be limited. Loss of mobility paired with cognitive limitations causes required on the clock care. Ultimately, the disease is fatal.
    
    Based on the AA (Alzheimer's Association) 2024 annual review [[1]](https://www.alz.org/getmedia/76e51bb6-c003-4d84-8019-e0779d8c4e8d/alzheimers-facts-and-figures.pdf):
    - Alzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for an estimated 60 - 80% of cases.
    - About 1 in 9 people (10.9%) age 65 and older in the U.S. has Alzheimer's dementia.

    #### Problem Statement
    
    Our research has two primary objectives:
    - To evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning models in accurately diagnosing Alzheimer's disease based on tabular data (non-image data), including demographic, 
    medical, and lifestyle factors.
    - To identify and quantify the most significant risk factors to inform intervention, prevention, and diagnostic strategies.

    #### Contents
    This application is based on a single, rich dataset containing demographic, lifestyle, and genetic information from individuals across 
    various countries. Source: [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankushpanday1/alzheimers-prediction-dataset-global)
    - The dashboard is organized across three pages:
        - **About the Data**
            - Initial Data Analysis (IDA) and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
            - Handling of missing values and outliers
            - Feature encoding and other preprocessing techniques
            - Visualization and analysis of feature distributions and correlations
        - **Modeling**: Evaluation of different machine learning models, including feature importance and interaction analysis.
            - Performance of multiple ML models on Alzheimer's diagnosis prediction
            - Analysis of top contributing features
            - Exploration of interaction effects and their impact on model performance
        - **Documentation**: Technical appendix covering feature details and references for sources.
