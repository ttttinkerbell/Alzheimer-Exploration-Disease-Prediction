    - Genetic Risk Factor (APOE-ε4 allele)
    - Family History of Alzheimer's

    Ultimately, no particular modeling results were especially inspiring. Lifestyle and demographic data features from this dataset showed to very predictive poorly predictive, contrary to many articles [[6]](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2272732#google_vignette).

    With this in mind, when using tabular data we recommend keeping models simple.
    - Even a simple benchmark conditional only on age proves to be nearly as performant as our complex models.
    - Complex interaction models may not provide significant additional predictive power beyond simpler models focusing on age, genetic factors, and family history.

    From our machine learning analysis, while most models were similar in performance, we recommend non-linear tree ensembles as a primary model. Evidently, they are able to capture the interaction space without exhaustively adding these features.
    In this case, because of their indifference in performance after the addition of these terms, we regard these models as
     more robust than the others, able to capture the strongest signal amongst noisy or less relevant features.

    Modern literature points to usage of image data or a combination of image and tabular (multi-modal) for producing more precise and confident results [[7]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19280) [[8]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00861).
